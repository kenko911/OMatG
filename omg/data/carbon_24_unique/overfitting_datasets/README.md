These two carbon duplicate datasets are among the highest frequency duplicate structures found in the original carbon dataset.
The train_NXL file is a carbon structure for which its replicas show up with different number of atoms per unit cell (N), different fractional coordinates (X), and different lattice vectors / rotations (L).
The train_X file is a carbon structure for which its replicas show up with the same lattice shape (L), and the same number of atoms per unit cell (N=6), but with different positions (X).
