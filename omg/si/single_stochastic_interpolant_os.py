class SingleStochasticInterpolantOS(StochasticInterpolant):
    """
    One-sided stochastic interpolant x_t = alpha(t) * x_0 + beta(t) * x_1 between points x_0 and x_1 from two
    distributions p_0 and p_1 at times t based on interpolating functions alpha(t) and beta(t) with
    alpha(0) = beta(1) = 1 and alpha(1) = beta(0) = 0. In this class, x_0 is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable in
    which case the effect of the latent variable z in the SingleStochasticInterpolant class can be merged with x_0.

    The stochastic interpolant can either use an ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a stochastic differential
    equation during inference. If an SDE is used, one should additionally provide an epsilon function epsilon(t).

    The ODE is integrated using the torchdiffeq library and the SDE is integrated using the torchsde library.

    In principle, one only needs to learn the denoiser for one-sided interpolants because the velocity field can derived
    from it (see Eq. (6.7) in the SI paper). However, the resulting velocity field is singular (though with a finite
    mean) which is why it might still be useful to learn the velocity field.
